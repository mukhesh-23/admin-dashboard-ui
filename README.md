# Admin Dashboard UI

This project is a frontend Admin Dashboard UI built using **React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS**.  
The project focuses on converting selected components from a Figma design into **clean, reusable, and pixel-accurate React components**.

Project Workflow (How I Did This Project)
1. Design Understanding
I started by analyzing the provided Figma design using Figma Dev Mode.
This helped me understand the layout structure, spacing, colors, typography, and assets.
The Figma design was treated as the single source of truth.

2. Project Setup
The project was initialized using Vite with React and TypeScript to ensure fast development and better code structure.
Tailwind CSS was chosen to maintain consistent styling and match the Figma design accurately.

3. Component Planning
Before coding, the UI was broken down into small and reusable components.
This helped in keeping the code clean, modular, and easy to maintain.

4. Component Development
Each component was developed individually to closely match the Figma design.
Once completed, all components were composed together to form the dashboard layout.

5. Styling Approach
Tailwind CSS utility classes were used to maintain:

Consistent spacing

Proper typography

Clean and responsive layout

The focus was always on UI accuracy and clarity, not on adding unnecessary features.

6. Code Quality & Structure
Special attention was given to:

Clean folder structure

Meaningful component names

Reusable components

Readable and maintainable code

Components Implemented
The following components were implemented:

Header (Top Navigation)

Footer

Sidebar

Stat Cards

Payment Transactions

Transactions Table

Activity Timeline

Each component is placed in its own folder for better modularity.

Development Decisions
React + TypeScript were used for better structure and type safety.

Vite was chosen for faster build and development experience.

Tailwind CSS helped in maintaining a clean and consistent UI.

The focus was kept on UI accuracy rather than building a full dashboard.

Time Taken
Design analysis & planning: ~1–2 hours

Component development & styling: ~6–7 hours

Refinement & deployment: ~1–2 hours

Total time: Approximately 9–11 hours

AI Tools Usage
AI tools were used only to assist the development process, such as:

Clarifying React and Tailwind usage

Speeding up repetitive boilerplate tasks

Debugging build and deployment issues

All UI implementation, component structure, and design decisions were manually done based on the Figma design.
