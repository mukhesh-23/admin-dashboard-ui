# Admin Dashboard UI

This project is a frontend Admin Dashboard UI built using **React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS**.  
The project focuses on converting selected components from a Figma design into **clean, reusable, and pixel-accurate React components**.

## Setup Steps

Follow the steps below to run the project locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mukhesh-23/admin-dashboard-ui.git
cd admin-dashboard-ui
npm install
npm run dev

arduino
http://localhost:5173
To create a production build:

bash
npm run build

Project Workflow (How I Did This Project)
Project: Creating
1. Design Understanding
First, I began analyzing a design from Figma using Figma Dev Mode.
This was very informative, as it helped me learn about layout structure, spacing, colors, typographies, spacing, and assets.

2. Project Setup
To start implementing the project, Vite with React and TypeScript was used. This ensured that development time was fast.
Tailwind CSS has been selected as it helps in maintaining the styles of the project in a similar manner as designed in Figma.

3. Component Planning
Before any code was written, a breakdown of the UI was completed.
This made the code organized and clean.

4. Component Development
Each component was developed separately to match the Figma design almost identically.
After that, all components were finally composed together to form a dashboard layout.

5. Styling Approach
Tailwind CSS utility classes were used to maintain:
Consistent spacing
Proper typography
Clean and responsive layout
The focus was on UI accuracy and clarity, not on adding unnecessary features.

6. Code Quality & Structure
Special attention was given to:
Clean folder structure
Meaningful component names
Reusable components
Readable and maintainable code
Components Implemented

The following components were implemented:
Header (Top Navigation)
Footer
Sidebar
Stat Cards
Payment Transactions
Transactions Table
Activity Timeline

Each element has its own directory for greater modularity.

Development Decisions

TypeError wasrected usingTS to get better structuring. React was used.

Vite is preferred because of faster building and development time.
Since we could use JavaScript

It assisted in keeping the UI component clean in this project through the usage of Tailwind CSS.

The focus was placed on how accurate the UI was, instead of developing a complete dashboard.

Time Spent
Design analysis & planning: 1 hour
Component Development & Styling: 4 hours
Refinement & deployment: 1 hour
Total time: Around 6 hours

Use of AI Tools
The AI systems were adopted solely to aid in the development process; these include

Improvement in React Skills Improvement in Tailwind Skills Improvement in Build Speed All the build-related issues are now debugged. Every implementation of the UI and designing decisions were done based on the Figma design.
